# 🐪 Camel Game - Text-Based Desert Adventure (PT Edition)
Camel Game (Portuguese Edition) is a terminal-based adventure game where you’ve stolen a camel and are now racing across the desert to escape your pursuer. This project is a localized and customized version of a classic text game, originally featured in the Arcade Python Book, fully translated and adapted into Portuguese (PT-BR).

# 🎮 Gameplay Overview
You’re in the desert with a stolen camel. The goal? Survive heat, thirst, and exhaustion while staying ahead of the camel's furious owner.

## Each turn, you can:
- A: Drink from your canteen
- B: Travel at moderate speed
- C: Travel at full speed
- D: Stop and rest for the night
- E: Check your status
- Q: Quit the game

## But beware:
- Your camel can get tired.
- You’ll get thirsty.
- The pursuer is always closing in.
- Random oases may appear — giving you a chance to rest, refill water, and reset exhaustion.
